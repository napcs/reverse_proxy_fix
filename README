#=REVERSE PROXY PLUGIN v1.03.1 (September 6th, 2007)
#===© 2006-2007 Brian Hogan
# 
#==Introduction
# This plugin is designed to allow your Rails application to reside behind a reverse proxy. 
# When the plugin is configured and the application is running in production mode, any URLs generated
# by Rails helpers will automatically be prefixed with the host and path you specify.
#
#==Example Usage
# An organization may be interested in running a Rails application behind a reverse proxy such as Apache. However,
# any URLs generated by the Rails appliction would expose the proxy.
#
# For example, a front-end server  http://www.mydomain.com/app1/   might be mapped to  http://backend.mydomain.com:3000/
#
# The plugin would be configured to prepend http://www.mydomain.com/app1 to all URLs generated by the application. 
#
#==Usage and Configuration
# Install via Subversion using the Ruby script/plugin install command. In the root of your Rails application structure
# (where you can see the app/ vendor/ and public/ folders)
# execute the following command:
#
#       ruby script/plugin install http://svn.napcsweb.com/public/reverse_proxy_fix
#
# You should be prompted to enter the base url of your front-end server when you install the plugin via script/plugin install.  You
# should not include the trainling slash! For example:
# 
#       http://www.mydomain.com/typo
#
# If that doesn't work for some reason, you can run the install.rb script in vendor/plugins/reverse_proxy_fix. Or you can manually
# edit the file lib/config.rb and uncomment the BASE_URL line. (It should be the only line in the file. Enter the desired base url 
# that you would like the plugin to prepend to any generated URLs.
#
# Then start your application in Production mode.  The plugin is automatically disabled when you run in development mode, so you don't
# need to do any special configurations to develop your application.
#
# That's it!
#
#== Revisions
#
# * Version 1.0.3.1
# ** Fixed an issue when using RESTful routing - plugin should no longer activate in dev mode.
#
# * Version 1.0.3
# ** Added a rake task to configure the plugin
# ** fixed a situation where the installer didn't work in Rails 1.2.3
# ** fixed a problem with request.request_uri not setting the base path.
# ** Overloaded routing mechanism to avoid collisions with the modified request.request_uri
# ** Tested with acts_as_authenticated
#
# * Version 1.0.2
# ** Fixed issue where page caching does not work. The URL rewriting can now be turned off by sending *:skip_relative_url_root => true* to any calls to url_for or link_to. (This is the method that caching uses to build the cached urls)
# * Version 1.0.1
# ** Small bug fix to allow :only_path => false to work correctly when called on link_to and url_for
# * Version 1.0
# ** Initial Release
